## What is this book about?
With extensive data being collected every second, computing power cannot keep up with this pace of rapid growth. To make use of all the data, Spark has become a de facto standard for big data processing. Migrating data processing to Spark will not only help you save resources that will allow you to focus on your business, but also enable you to modernize your workloads by leveraging the capabilities of Spark and the modern technology stack for creating new business opportunities.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create and manipulate SQL queries in Spark
* Build complex Spark functions using Spark UDFs
* Architect big data apps with Spark fundamentals for optimal design
* Apply techniques to manipulate and optimize big data applications
* Build real-time or near-real-time applications using Spark Streaming
* Work with Apache Spark for machine learning applications
